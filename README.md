## To start project
- cd chatbot-reactjs (change into correct directory)
- npm install (install all dependencies)
- npm run dev (start up a local server to run)

## Approach
Researched and looked into how to make an effective chatbot, then researched how to choose the correct phone for you. Drew out inital sketches for how I wanted the conversation paths to flow, before moving the design into FigJam. Created a Chatbot UI, and eventually created an external JSON which would be fetched to find 
the corresponding options to be displayed, as well as the corresponding bot response. Used buttons to streamline this process. Created a google slide to showcase the project, and create a markdown to encapsulate everything.
