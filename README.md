## To start project
- cd chatbot-reactjs (change into correct directory)
- npm install (install all dependencies)
- npm run dev (start up a local server to run)

## Approach
I conducted research on creating effective chatbot and guides on how to choose the right phone. Utilizing these insights, I sketched initial conversation paths and transferred the design into FigJam for organization. I created the chatbot UI and developed an external JSON file to store corresponding conversation options and bot responses, which are fetched dynamically. I chose the external JSON approach in order to better make room for scalibility, in case more choices or questions need to be asked in the future. To streamline user interactions, I incorporated buttons for easier navigation. Finally, I created a Google Slide presentation to showcase the project and drafted a markdown document to encapulsate the entire process.
